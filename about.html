  <h1>About EIgame</h1>

  <p>
    ElgameLOL is an illustrator, animator and composer from Thailand. His nickname is "Game" but why the "EI" prefix? Because it's a Thai slang term used "ไอ้" so in Thai it's called "ไอ้เกม" and have so many socials of YouTube, Discord, Tik Tok, Instagram, Newground, Twitter and Spotify for listening song album

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>
    In 2020, Game started his own YouTube channel called &quot;SaffranyeepongXP.&quot; It was a small channel posting Among Us animations and random videos-a typical channel with just random stuff. Towards the end of 2021, Game old account started to get suspended, so Game abandoned the channel, leaving it completely inactive. It's really a shame.</p>

  <p>
    Then, in 2024, Game started using a new account called &quot;Elgame,&quot; but didn't post anything on YouTube anymore. Game joined Discord in January and joined @Tonoboi Tonezcord server, posting Eddsworld drawings, chatting, encouraging each other, and following each Tono. Tono and his friends grew up supporting Game and becoming best friends forever. At that time, Game YouTube channel featured Eddsworld reanimations, animations of Eddsworld remade with different art styles. Game stopped making Eddsworld reanimations at the end of 2024 because it might infringe on their copyright. Game then continued only drawing fan art for Eddsworld on Discord.</p>

  <p>
    By 2025, Game started creating his own Tik Tok account and posting animated memes, which garnered tens of thousands of views. Tik Tok has become a prominent platform for posting now.</p>
